<font size=1><br>A major research task in asset pricing is predicting the value of future stock returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored task—predicting the direction of future stock returns. Theoretically, a simple model in Christoffersen and Diebold (2006) suggests that direction prediction is closely related to the widely recognized volatility clustering effect. Empirically, we compare the direction and value prediction of the S&P500 excess returns via a variety of models, including linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination methods. The general findings indicate that for a typical investor, direction prediction generates greater economic gains than value prediction does because of the information embedded in volatility and higher moments of returns. From the models’ perspectives, while machine learning and combination methods can enhance both direction and value prediction, the enhancement is more significant in the realm of direction prediction, and the predictive power stems from the volatility mechanism. Additional analyses suggest that value and direction prediction share similar stock market risk factors.</font>
